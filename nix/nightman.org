* The Nightman

The Nightman Cometh
   for secrets that shouldn't be out after dark.

Check out secrets from the Nightman. Don't keep them longer than you
need them or he will take his secrets back forcibly.

Here is how the Nightman keeps track of his records.

In the beginning, the Nightman has all secrets under control.
- To decrypt a secret, 'checkout' a file. If necessary, be ready with
  authentication.*
- When you are done with your secret, appease the Nightman by 'return'ing
  the file
- To clear bad locks, use 'flush'

  *Authentication is only necessary when the secret is not already decrypted.
